# JSONRestAPI

A simple web server to get information about your server via PlaceholderAPI.

## Installing

Requirements:
- Spigot 1.16.5 (or its forks, Paper recommended!)
- A host that lets you listen on non-Minecraft ports

Simply download the plugin and add it to your server's plugins folder. More configuration may be required.

## Configuring

Configuring the plugin is only required to make your life easier, or to open up the server to be queried by others.

The config.yml is heavily documented, so head there to see what needs to be done. 
Anything extra I'd put on the Wiki, so go there, too.

## Sponsored?

This plugin is currently not sponsored (and never will be, by a host at least).

If you would like to support me, feel free to Sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Chew)!

However, it is endorsed by Rory!
